_Pollito Opinionated Spring-Boot Template_

This is a **Java Spring Boot** project that serves as a support repository for the blog series [Spring Boot Development](https://pollito.dev/en/categories/spring-boot-development/).

## Objectives

In the blog series, we aim to achieve the following goals:

1. **Be a starting point for future Spring Boot projects.**
2. **Embrace Component-Driven Development (CDD) practices.**
3. **Encapsulate essential dependencies and best-practice boilerplate.**
4. **Give the developer ownership and control over the code.**

The repository contains all the essential components, configurations, and best practices discussed throughout the series. It is designed to help developers understand how to do Spring Boot applications.

For more posts and updates on Spring Boot and other development topics, check out my blog: [pollito.dev](https://pollito.dev/).

Happy coding! üê§
