_Pollito Opinionated Spring-Boot Template_

This is a **Java Spring Boot** project that serves as a support repository for the blog series [Spring Boot Development](https://pollito.dev/en/categories/spring-boot-development/).

## Objectives

In the blog series, we aim to achieve the following goals:

1. **Be a starting point for future Spring Boot projects.**
2. **Embrace Component-Driven Development (CDD) practices.**
3. **Encapsulate essential dependencies and best-practice boilerplate.**
4. **Give the developer ownership and control over the code.**

The repository contains all the essential components, configurations, and best practices discussed throughout the series. It is designed to help developers understand how to do Spring Boot applications.
